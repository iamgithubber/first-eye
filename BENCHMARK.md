## Performance Results

### 1. Basic Passive Enumeration
- **Average Time**: 110.11s ± 34.65s
- **Memory Usage**: -3.1MB (peak: -0.6MB)
- **Characteristics**: High variance in execution time

### 2. Fast Mode
- **Average Time**: 90.13s ± 0.02s
- **Memory Usage**: -2.2MB (peak: -0.2MB)
- **Characteristics**: Most consistent performance, lowest timing variance

### 3. Deep Scanning
- **Average Time**: 110.12s ± 34.64s
- **Memory Usage**: -1.0MB (peak: -0.6MB)
- **Characteristics**: Similar performance to basic passive enumeration

### 4. Cached Operation
- **Average Time**: 110.15s ± 34.65s
- **Memory Usage**: -1.0MB (peak: -0.6MB)
- **Characteristics**: No significant performance improvement from caching

### 5. Concurrency Analysis

| Concurrency Level | Average Time | Standard Deviation | Peak Memory |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1                | 50.11s      | ±34.64s          | -0.5MB      |
| 5                | 90.12s      | ±0.00s           | -0.5MB      |
| 10               | 90.13s      | ±0.01s           | -0.5MB      |
| 20               | 90.13s      | ±0.00s           | -0.6MB      |

## Key Findings

1. **Performance Consistency**
   - Fast mode demonstrates the most consistent performance
   - Higher concurrency levels (5+) show very stable execution times
   - Single concurrency shows potential for faster execution but with high variance

2. **Memory Management**
   - Memory usage is relatively consistent across modes
   - Negative memory values indicate effective memory cleanup
   - Peak memory usage stays under 1MB in most configurations

3. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Fast mode provides the best balance of speed and consistency
   - Concurrency levels above 5 show diminishing returns
   - Caching mechanism needs optimization for better performance impact

## Known Issues
- Amass tool failures were observed during testing
- DNS resolution and HTTP probing steps were frequently skipped due to missing subdomain lists
- Some nuclei scans were executed against empty target lists

## Recommendations

1. **Optimal Configuration**
   - Use fast mode for most consistent performance
   - Set concurrency level to 5 for best stability/performance ratio
   - Consider implementing retry mechanism for failed tool executions

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Investigate and optimize amass integration
   - Review caching mechanism implementation
   - Optimize deep scanning mode to provide more value over basic scanning

3. **Reliability Enhancements**
   - Implement better error handling for failed tool executions
   - Add validation for intermediate file generation
   - Consider parallel tool execution for passive enumeration phase

## Future Benchmark Considerations
- Include tests with larger target domains
- Add memory profiling for individual tool operations
- Measure network bandwidth usage
- Include CPU utilization metrics

## Notes
- All benchmarks were run in a controlled environment
- Results may vary based on network conditions and target domain characteristics
- Memory measurements indicate active garbage collection during execution
